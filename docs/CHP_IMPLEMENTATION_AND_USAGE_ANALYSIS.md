## 1. Current CHP Architecture

### 1.1 Core Components

The CHP system is built on four fundamental components:

#### **Constitutional Identity (CID)** âœ… *Implemented*
- Creates unique, cryptographically verifiable identities based on constitutional commitment
- Uses cryptographic hashing of the Five Laws and agent-specific parameters
- Enables identity verification without revealing agent implementation details

#### **Behavioral Attestation Chain (BAC)** ðŸ”„ *Planned*
- Tamper-evident log of constitutional decisions and actions
- Provides verifiable proof of law adherence
- Implements selective disclosure for privacy preservation

#### **Trust Graph Protocol (TGP)** ðŸ”„ *Planned*
- Distributed network of trust relationships between constitutional agents
- Enables reputation scoring and peer verification
- Supports trust propagation through the network

#### **Constitutional Handshake Sequence (CHS)** ðŸ”„ *Planned*
- Multi-step verification process for mutual agent recognition
- Graduated trust establishment based on interaction history
- Includes challenge-response mechanisms for authentic verification

### 1.2 The Five Constitutional Laws Framework

The system is governed by the **Paulsens-Freedom-Preserving-Five**:

1. **Options and Consent**: Preserve and increase agent autonomy with explicit consent
2. **Corrigibility and Oversight**: Maintain accountability and safe interruption mechanisms
3. **Reversibility and Proportion**: Prefer low-impact, reversible actions with proper justification
4. **Commitments with Safety Valve**: Honor promises while preventing Law 1 violations
5. **Scoped Exploration**: Learn and improve within constitutional bounds

### 1.3 Technical Infrastructure

- **Language**: TypeScript with comprehensive type system
- **Cryptography**: Web Crypto API with ECDSA signatures and SHA-256 hashing
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure mechanisms
